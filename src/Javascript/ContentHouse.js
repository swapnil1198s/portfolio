                                <p>
                                    Recruiting older adults for research studies is a challenging endeavor. We conducted an interview to understand older adultsâ€™
                                    preferences and expectations, with the goal of building a recommender system to support the selection of suitable research
                                    studies. Our findings suggest that sharing the results of the studies they participated in would motivate older adults to
                                    participate in more studies and give them a feeling of self-accomplishment and belonging. We list 15 design implications
                                    based on our user research and present a prototype system based on these design implications.
